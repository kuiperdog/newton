A simple site to check Gravity results as COMO are being counted.

Please note that this is currently only a proof of concept - any 0.x versions are considered to be early beta. The current design and/or functionality may not reflect the functionality of version 1.0, and bugs are to be expected. I'm not very experienced with Vue, so please bear with slower than average development speeds. If you'd like to help out, pull requests are welcome!
